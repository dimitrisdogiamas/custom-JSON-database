In this project, I developed a custom JSON-based database to store and manage personal information. The database is built using the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring flexibility in data management. Data is loaded from a separate JSON file, and various functionalities allow for seamless reading, editing, and manipulation of the information within the database.
